# Ray-Tracing-Using-SDL3-in-C
This is an attempt to develop a simple ray tracing algorithm that demonstrates it's functionalities. 

Ray tracing is a computer graphics technique that simulates how light behaves in the real world. It's used to create realistic images and graphics for games, movies, and more.

This attempt is not an efficient one, this approach is a starting point which is to be improved further using better mathematical formulas. 

This is the result from the program, it is very basic and simple but it works.
